# 🎯 Ruby X SerpApi Challenge

## ✌️ Introduction
Hi, I have recently came across this web scraper called SerpApi. From a glance, it looks very interesting and thus I have decided that I would like to try using it! 
Not only that, but to make this challenge fun, as well as to improve how I pick up unfamiliar technologies, I will be experimenting on both Ruby on Rails and SerpApi.
I will update what I have done on each day inside this repository, as well as to consolidate my learnings =)

## ⚙️ Technologies
- Ruby on Rails
- SerpApi
- DigitalOcean (deployment)
- MongoDb (Probably)
