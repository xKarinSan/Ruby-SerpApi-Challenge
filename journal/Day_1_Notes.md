## 5/3/25 Entry
To gain a better picture about Ruby and Ruby on Rails, I watched the following videos:
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYm0kfnRTJk">Ruby in 100 seconds</a>
- <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DvrRadXwWY">Ruby on Rails in 100 Seconds</a>

From these videos, I learnt there were many similarities from my experiences such as:
- declaration of variables are similar to Python
- MVC framework similar to C# .net
- ```rails new <project_name>``` is similar to ```npm init``` for Express JS
- ```gemfile``` is similar to ```requirements.txt``` in Python and ```package.json``` is similar to any Javascript-related projects.

I also installed ruby on my computer =D to get the ball rolling.

In the following days, I will be exploring Ruby in greater depth and write more about it.

PS: I wrote this at the start of 6/3/25.

***TL;DR: Watched Ruby and Rails intro videos, noticing similarities with Python, .NET, and JavaScript. Installed Ruby on my computer to start hands-on learning. Excited to dive deeper in the coming days! ðŸš€ (Written on 6/3/25)***
